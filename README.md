# Philosophers

Philosophers is a multi-threading process where we have to maintain some actuals philosophers alive around a table as long as possible.

They have forks available on their left and right, but only one spaghetti bowl on the center.

This project is useful to understand the Mutex and multi-threading algorithms in C.
